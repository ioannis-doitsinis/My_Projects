# __Project Overview__
This project is part of my Master's Thesis research, aimed at demonstrating a portion of the work involved.

## __Thesis Topic__:
"Image Classification Task: Distinguishing Web Advertisements from Regular Content"

The repository includes the code for the custom model we developed, which was trained on a dataset of approximately 35,000 images scraped from hundreds of websites. Unfortunately, due to restrictions, the dataset itself is not publicly available, but the model code is provided as part of the demonstration.

## __Model Performance:__
Our custom model achieved an 85% accuracy in distinguishing advertisements from regular web content. For comparison, we also tested a "state-of-the-art" pre-trained model, MobileNet. After fine-tuning it's architecture and hyperparameters, MobileNet achieved an accuracy of around 90%.

While MobileNet outperformed our custom model, the results show that our model performed quite well considering the complexity of the task.

## __How to Use:__
The Jupyter notebook "Custom Model-Image Classifier.ipynb" is available for donwload but viewing it doesnt work here in GitHub. For that reason, i provide also the code in the "Custom Model-Image Classifier.md" file.
