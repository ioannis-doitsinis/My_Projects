In this project we will try to build a model based on Recurrent Neural Networks that will predict the Close values of a stock.

For this case, we picked the historycal data from the last 10 years for the TESLA Inc. (TSLA) stock.

The model will focus on the Last/Close price of the stock to forecast the future prices.


Results:

The Orange line, i.e. our predictions, is at the most part almost ontop of the Validation line, so we can say that the model is quite good.
