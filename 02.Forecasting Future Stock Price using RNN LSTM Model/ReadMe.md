This Project is part of my Master's Thesis research and I include it to demonstrate part of the work.

The Thesis subject is: "Image classification task: Distinguish Web advertisements from regular content"


I include the code for the custom model which we developed, which was trained on a Dataset of about 35.000 images taken (scraped) from hundrents of websites.
Unfortunately, the Dataset is not publicly available therefore i include only the code of the model for demonstrating part of our work. 



Our model achived 85% accuracy identifying Advertisement contect from regular content. 
When compared to other "State-of-the-art" pre-trained models, like the MobileNet, we can see that our model did quite well.
The MobileNet network achived accuracy around 90% after fine-tuning the archiotecture and the hyperparameters.
