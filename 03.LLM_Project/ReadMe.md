# __Project Overview__

In this project, I developed an AI-powered career recommendation system using GPT-2. The goal was to provide personalized career path suggestions based on a userâ€™s skills, interests, and strengths. 
Initially, the baseline GPT-2 model was tested without fine-tuning to evaluate its general performance. 
Subsequently, the model was fine-tuned on a specialized dataset of job descriptions to enhance its recommendation capabilities, highlighting my expertise in natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and model fine-tuning.
