## üöÄ My Project Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository showcases a collection of personal and academic projects that I developed during my Master's studies and beyond. It serves as a living portfolio of my growth, learning, and skills in various domains of software development, data analysis, and machine learning.

## üéØ Purpose

This repository is intended as a centralized portfolio of my work, suitable for inclusion in my CV and for potential employers or collaborators to review the scope of my experience and expertise.

## üìÅ Repository Contents
1. **Master‚Äôs Project:** *Image classification task: Distinguish Web advertisements from regular content*
   
   This is the main project I worked on during my Master's studies. It was an in-depth exploration of Convolutional Neural Networks, focusing on solving an image classification task using Python and the Libraries: Tensorflow and Keras.

* Technologies: Python, Keras, Tensorflow
* Brief Description: Developed a novel Deep Neural Network Model that classifies Web Content into Advertisement and Non-Advertisement and compared it against "State-of-the-Art" Pre-Trained Models
* Key Achievements: Our Custom Model achieved **85%** accuracy on the task, while the best of the "State-of-the-art" models achieved **90%** accuracy.

2. **Other Notable Projects**
   
* __Forecast Stock Prices using Recurent Neural Networks (RNN)__
  
   In this project, we built a model based on Recurrent Neural Networks that can predict the Close values of the TESLA Inc. (TSLA) stock.
  
   Technologies: RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Pandas, Keras and TensorFlow.


## üìä Skills and Technologies
Throughout the development of these projects, I have gained experience in the following areas:

* Programming Languages: Python
* Frameworks & Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Matplotlib
* Other Tools: Git
