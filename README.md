🚀 My Project Portfolio
Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository showcases a collection of personal and academic projects that I developed during my Master's studies and beyond. It serves as a living portfolio of my growth, learning, and skills in various domains of software development, data analysis, and machine learning.

🎯 Purpose
This repository is intended as a centralized portfolio of my work, suitable for inclusion in my CV and for potential employers or collaborators to review the scope of my experience and expertise.

📁 Repository Contents
1. Master’s Project: *Image classification task: Distinguish Web advertisements from regular content*
This is the main project I worked on during my Master's studies. It was an in-depth exploration of Convolutional neural networks (CNN), focusing on solving an image classification problem using Python together with Tensorflow and Keras libraries.

* Technologies: **Python, Keras, Tensorflow**
* Brief Description: Developed a novel Deep Neural Network Model that classifies Web Content into Advertisement and Non-Advertisement and compared it against "State-of-the-art" Pre-Trained Models.
* Key Achievements: Our Custom model achieved **85%** accuracy on the task, while the best "State-of-the-art" Pre-Trained CNN model achieved **90%** accuracy. 

2. Other Notable Projects
   
* __Forecast Stock Prices using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)__
  
   In this project, we built a model based on Recurrent Neural Networks that can predict the Close values of the TESLA Inc. (TSLA) stock.
  
   Technologies used include RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Pandas, Keras, and Tensorflow.
