## 📁 Repository Contents
### 🎓**Master’s Project:** *Image classification task: Distinguish Web advertisements from regular content*
   
   This is the main project I worked on during my Master's studies. It was an in-depth exploration of Convolutional Neural Networks, focusing on solving an image classification task using Python and the Libraries: Tensorflow and Keras.

* **Technologies**: Python, Keras, Tensorflow
* **Brief Description**: Developed a novel Deep Neural Network Model that classifies Web Content into Advertisement and Non-Advertisement and compared it against "State-of-the-Art" Pre-Trained Models
* **Key Achievements**: Our Custom Model achieved **85%** accuracy on the task, while the best of the "State-of-the-art" models achieved **90%** accuracy.


### 📈 Forecast Stock Prices using Recurent Neural Networks (RNN)
  
   In this project, I developed a model based on Recurrent Neural Networks that can predict the Close values of the TESLA Inc. (TSLA) stock.
  
 *  **Technologies**: RNN, Pandas, Keras and TensorFlow.
 *  **Brief Description**: Developed an RNN model to predict Tesla Inc. (TSLA) stock close prices by capturing temporal dependencies in stock market data.
 *  **Key Achievements**: The LSTM model demonstrated a predictive accuracy of 90%, providing valuable insights into time-series forecasting.


## 📊 Skills and Technologies
Throughout the development of these projects, I have gained experience in the following areas:

* **Programming Languages**: Python
* **Frameworks & Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Matplotlib
* **Other Tools**: Git
